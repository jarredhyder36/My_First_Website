	<td><p> Lebron James hasn't missed the playoffs since 2005 as well as not missing the finals since 2010 and he doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon! Although people may say their team isn't strong enough, it's a lot better than the team he lost in the finals with last year and they have the pieces on the team to make a run. Moreover, Lakers tickets have skyrocketed ever since LeBron joined the team and have became the talk of the NBA. However, fans around the world should not get confused on who the best Laker is and will be for a very long time... </p></td>
